# MultiWordFinder
Given a list of multiple words in "query.txt", highlight all instances of them in MS Word files in the directory "Raw Data". The program will create a new file (in the same directory) with the highlighted content for each MS Word file as "FileName - Copy.DOCX"

A line in query.txt is "Word, Color" or "Word". This will highlight the Word in the non black/white/grey color chosen. If no color is picked, the word will be highlighted in yellow.
